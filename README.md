## Description

The motivation for develping SmartTax was to make taxes easy. Taxes can be complicated it dose not have to be.
SmartTax is a full stack web application where a user can register to have access to the main tax section where they can view tax reports based on user data. The application alows user to view tax resources, register, add and delete tax reports.

The application was built using the MVC paradigm using:

-   Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
-   Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
-   MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
-   authentication (express-session and cookies).

2. Create database on MySQL using schema.sql file
3. Add .env file with database details
4. Use "npm run seed" in the terminal
5. Use "npm start" in the terminal
